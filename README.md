About Me

Claire hails from the right side of the Pennines, but moved to Manchester in 2013, and has been immersed in the tech scene ever since. Her first experience of the tech community was when she attended BarCamp Blackpool in 2011, and was subjected to the wonders of this amazing community.

Coming from a non tech background, Claire loved that the BarCamp catered to geeks of all levels of knowledge, and in a sense was all about community & sharing knowledge. Claireâ€™s love of BarCamps continued & she attended BarCamp Blackpool in 2012, followed by BarCamp Liverpool 2012, and BarCamp Blackpool 2013. In 2014, it was sadly announced that BarCamp Blackpool would not be happening that year, and a big hole had been left in the community.

Early in the year, the Manchester Girl Geeks put on a #BraCamp, and it became ever more apparent that there was still a huge need for the unconference in the North West. Seeing the need to fill this hole left by BarCamp Blackpool, in 2013, along with Ian Forrester & Dave Mee, Claire revived BarCamp Manchester after a long hiatus, and organised a massively successful 2 day overnight unconference in Spaceport in October for 160 people.

Alongside BarCamp Manchester, Claire also assisted Sam Headleand in reviving GeekUp Manchester, which now meets every other month on the 1st Thursday at the English Lounge in the Northern Quarter. Igniting her love of event organisation and giving back to the tech community, when Pam Wheeler complained that there was no support for adults who want to learn how to code, Claire knew that this was a project she could bring to life!

Claire also runs her own website GirlGeekUpNorth, where she writes about various aspects of her life, including tech events and reviews of various horror and geek attractions she attends. She is also a keen pervasive gamer, playing Werewolf once a month and can occasionally be found playing Ingress, Geocashing or Geohashing on a weekend.
